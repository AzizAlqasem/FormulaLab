**search** in formulas database, and **mange** your formulas database to
connect it effeciently to your code.



:Why FormulaLab:

**FormulaLab allows you to:**

* Derive formulas algebraically by going through the formulas database and solving for the wanted *function* as a function of the wanted *variable*.

* Conveient search for formula(s) in a database.

* Convert symbolic formulas that you pulled up from the database into python functions, where you can subtitute numbers and evaluate anywhere in your code.

* Have the confort of having all of your formulas in one place, so they can be maneged and controlled very easly, safely, and efficiently.

# FormulaLab
FormulaLab is a search engine for mathmatical equations in a database. The formulas could be in any scientific filed (eg., math, physics, chemistry, ...). FormulaLab searches through formulas database and fiend the desired variable(as a function of other variable(s)) either directly of indirectly. The indirect search is by going through analytical subtitutions to connect two variables and form a new formula that is not in the database. FormulaLab provide a convienant envieronment to store, find and use multiple formulas in your database to implement them in your code. FormulaLab depends mainly in [SymPy]( https://sympy.org/), A computer algebra system written in pure Python. The goal of FormulaLab is to be the ultimate tool when working with formula database.
